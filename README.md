Simple money tracking app since all another I found requires a subscription

Goals:

- Free to use forever. Only voluntary donations.

- Full offline mode. Do not use any type of servers to store data.
  All data should be stored locally using sqlite.
  Maybe will add a backup functionality, but it'll use only external services without any proxy backend owned be me

Stack:

- Bun runtime
- React Native & Expo & Bridgeless Mode & React Compiler
- TypeScript
- TanStack Query, Form
- Drizzle ORM & Expo SQLite
- UI Kitten
